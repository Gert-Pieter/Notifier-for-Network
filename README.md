# Notifier-for-Network

## About The Repository 

This is a script file that will detect if the network goes down.
It's very simple and easy to understand and was made because I use data and at times there will be disconnection and I won't know.

Copy the .zip file and extract to your computer. To run it in the backgrond press windows + R and type in shell:startup. Copy the file with .pyw. You'll need to have python before that. You can find it at https://www.python.org/downloads/
